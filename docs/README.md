# @FinBlox
**A collection of useful financial "Blox" used to quickly mock financial systems**

[Full documentation is available here](https://markjose.github.io/FinBlox/)

## Motivation
When building front end financial systems, sometimes it is useful for developers to separate themselves from an unreliable API which is still in production.
FinBlox server components are designed to be quick to set up and give realistic data, in order that front end developers are not blocked by other teams.

## Getting Started 
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/markjose/FinBlox.git`
2. `cd ./FinBlox`
3. Install the node modules `yarn install`
4. `cd ./src/examples`
5. Run an example `node ./tick-generator` or `node ./order-book`
